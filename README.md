# Application-Server-Herd

### Score: 100/100

This project implements an Application Server Herd architecture to create a Location App, in which clients can provide readily-updatable GPS-based locations then request nearby attractions. It is implemented with Python, the asyncio library, and Google Maps API. 

More details on the implementation, as well as the benefits and pitfalls of this approach as opposed to other languages/frameworks, is included in report.pdf. The server and client code is located the project directory. 

This was my final project for UCLA's CS 131 -- Programming Languages. 

Note: To run, you must insert your own Google API key at line 8 of server.py.
